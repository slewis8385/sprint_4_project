1. Project's Title: Comparing Vehicle Price and Vehicle Model 

2. Project Description: The objective of this project was to familiarize myself with several applications including Anaconda, PowerShell Prompt, VSCode, Jupyter Notebook, Github, and Render.  Within VSCode I built my directory to include Streamlit, EDA notebooks, app.py, README, and my csv vehicle_us file. I was able to import pandas and plotly express and view the csv dataset in EDA as well as clean the data, searching for duplicates and missing values, replace applicable missing values, and utilize app.py st.header, st.write, and st.checkbox to describe vehicle price vs. vehicle model, specifically those under 20K using a histogram and scatterplot. I also familiarized myself with Github and Render to ensure my reader had central accessibility to my repository and the created weblink to my VSCode project.
