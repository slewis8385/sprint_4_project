# sprint_4_project 
I decided to compare the price and model of vehicles within the vehicles csv dataset and created a histogram and scatter plot using st.write for visualization. I ulilzed this tool to explain this particular random event (price and model) the same tool could've been used to explore various categories within the dataset such as odemoter and model or transmition and type. I first imported streamlit, pandas, plotly express, and the vehicles csv file in app.py within the VS Code application. I then labeled my graphs 'Vehicle Analysis' using st.header and used st.checkbox to show only cars under $20K. I ran streamlit run app.py in the Terminal which depicted my histogram and scatter plot.  The scatter plot was a bit cluttered, this histogram presented more clear and concise results.  One could view this project and it's results locally through the appropriate methods and libraries if it were sent to them.  It can be found under sprint_4_project.
