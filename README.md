1. Project's Title: Comparing Vehicle Price and Vehicle Model 

2. Project Description: The objective of this project was to familirize myself with several applications including Anaconda PowerShell Prompt, VSCode, Jupyter Notebook, Github, and Render.  Within VSCode I built my directorty to include Streamlit, EDA notebooks, app.py, README, and my csv vehicle_us file. I was able to import pandas and plotly express and view the csv dataset in EDA as well as clean the data, searching for duplicates and missing values, replace applicable missing values, and utilize app.py st.header, st.write, and st.checkbox to describe my histogram and scatterplot to help the reader visualize vehicle price vs vehicle model and those specifically less than 20K. I also familirized myself with Github and Render to ensure my reader had central accessability to my repository, and the created weblink to my VSCode project.
